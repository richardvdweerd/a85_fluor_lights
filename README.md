# DCC Fluorencent Lights for model trains

Fluorencent lights simulator 

Function 4 turns lights on in random order, flickering while turning on to simulate fluorescent tube lights
Function 0 turns front / rear lights on, depending on direction
Depending on speed (<=1) and direction, the cab light (the last neopixel) is turned on

Depends on custom hardware on EasyEda:

TODO:
 - test on functions F13 - F28 (my handhelds don't support these numbers)

Nice to have
 - possibility to remotely change decoder address on main or program track
 - possibility to remotely change light/color of the neopixels
